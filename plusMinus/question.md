Given an array of integers,
calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero.
Print the ratios of positive, negative and zero values in the array.
Each value should be printed on a separate line with 6 digits after the decimal. The function should not return a value. 

Example
arr =[1, 1, 0, -1, -1]
There are n=5 elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are 0.4, 0.4, and 0.2.

Results are printed as:

0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
